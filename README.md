# DRAGON CSS FRAMEWORK 🤑
Take flight with Dragon today! 

# NEW AND IMPROVED 😍
This is version 2.0 of the original 'dragon-css' and in order to live up to it's name it needed some serious upgrades. For starters: We are now using SCSS to quickly compile a large amount of css code from a simpler, quicker to write .scss file. Another exciting new upgrade is the availability of fine tuning in all colors, margins, borders and padding, for instance: The colors have 49 levels of shading (0 - brightest, 49 - darkest). NOTE: If you want to use level 0 color shading you will have to omit the '-0' from the end of the color (e.g. 'primary-37' => 'primary-37', 'primary-0 => 'primary'). 

# CURRENTLY SUPPORTED FEATURES 🤗
- GRID
  - class='container' - Now using flexbox to stablize and extend our capabilities.
  - class='row' - Pretty much the same as before 😬
