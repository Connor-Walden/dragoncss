# DRAGON CSS FRAMEWORK 🤑
Take flight with Dragon today! 

# NEW AND IMPROVED 😍
This is version 2.0 of the original 'dragon-css' and in order to live up to it's name it needed some serious upgrades. For starters: We are now using SCSS to quickly compile a large amount of css code from a simpler, quicker to write .scss file. Another exciting new upgrade is the availability of fine tuning in all colours, margins, borders and padding, for instance: The colours have 49 levels of shading (0 - brightest, 49 - darkest). NOTE: If you want to use level 0 colour shading you will have to omit the '-0' from the end of the colour (e.g. 'primary-37' => 'primary-37', 'primary-0 => 'primary').
